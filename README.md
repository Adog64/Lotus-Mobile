### The PB Scramble

- All scrambles are generated in real-time and are displayed while the "Ready" button is visible. 

### Keep your Eye on the Ball

- Ready to begin your 15-second inspection period? Tap the ready button and begin inspecting. 
- Once you have your triple X-Cross planned out (or if you're like me, 2 cross pieces), tap the timer again to begin your solve.
- Tap the timer one last time when you finish your solve to stop it.
- Screw up? No worries, DNF and +2 buttons appear after each solve.
- The single button design will allow you to focus on improvement instead of searching for buttons.

### Yay Numbers!
- Session statistics are available below the timer as well as on the solves page.
- If you find a time that "doesn't count" you can tap on it on the solves page to edit it.

### Additional Notes
The Alpha 1.0 Release of Lotus is an Android-only preview of the Lotus cubing timer. The iPhone release will be out soon. 
Download Lotus.apk in the releases section of the tags page to get started!
